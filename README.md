# Description
This code emulates how a real minesweeper game would function by the execution of commands in the command line terminal. It contains the same game rules, displays a board and the set adjacency counts for each cell, and randomly distributes mines. This game allows the user to enter the number of rows, columns and mines on the board with the "new" command. Then the player can view the board by entering the "show" command. The user's objective is to flag all the mines without uncovering them, otherwise they will lose the game.
